    "# Gradients\n",
    "It represents derivative in case of multivariate function with respect to each variable.  It is a **vector** with each element being partial derivate with respect to the variables. We use the symbol nabla ($\\nabla$) to represent the operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets us consider $\\nabla f(x,y)$ at (2,3), where $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}  \\end{bmatrix}f(x,y)$$  \n",
    "#### What is this crazy symbol $\\partial $ ?\n",
    "It just means that you are taking derivate with respect to one of the variables treating the other one as constant.\n",
    "$$\\nabla (x^2+y^2) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x\\\\ 2y  \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting Gradient Direction \n",
    "Direction of gradient gives me information about how the variables should change to make the function have larger value.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Interpreting Gradient Magnitude\n",
    "It gives me the total rate of change at a given point in domain. So if magnitude of gradient is higher than the function is changing steeply at that point\n",
